# 1st January 2026

To set myself a challenge I have decided to attempt to fill in every square of my GitHub contributions graph this year.
This means making at least one commit every day for the entire year of 2026.

To track my progress I will be making daily entries in this journal, this will include days where I have done nothing to take full accountability of my commitment.
